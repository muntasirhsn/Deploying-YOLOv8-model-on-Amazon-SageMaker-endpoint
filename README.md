# Deploying-YOLOv8-model-on-Amazon-SageMaker-endpoint
YOLO You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The latest YOLOv8 is  known for its runtime efficiency as well as detection accuracy. To utilise its potential deploying the 
model at scale is crucial. Here, a YOLOv8 model is hosted on the Amazon SageMaker endpoint and inference was run for input images/videos for object detection. To accomplish this task, the solution developed by the 
AWS machine learning team ([GitHub link](https://github.com/aws-samples/host-yolov8-on-sagemaker-endpoint)) was adopted with some modifications of the codes to account for object detection in video frames. 

#### Details will be updated soon...
